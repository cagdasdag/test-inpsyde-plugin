- When installed, the plugin has to make available a custom endpoint on the WordPress site. With “custom endpoint” we mean an arbitrary URL not recognized by WP as a standard URL, like a permalink or so.
  - After activating, custom endpoint available at
    - http://127.0.0.1:10180/?pagename=custom-inpsyde if pretty URL mode not turned on
    - http://127.0.0.1:10180/custom-inpsyde/ if pretty URL mode on
  - This custom endpoint set up with hook `init` before main WordPress parse request process fired to avoid extra actions on widgets ... https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference
  - If you want to use the theme, we can use hook `parse_query`
